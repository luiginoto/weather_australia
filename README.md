Capstone project for DSGA-1001 Introduction to Data Science class of MS in Data Science at NYU.

The project was carried out in collaboration with other NYU students.
Perfomed hypothesis testing (resampling methods) on temperature data to investigate climate change. Trained and validated ML classification models to predict next day rain occurrence (XGBoost with 0.89 test AUC, 0.75 test average precision score).

More specifically, the authors wanted answers to the following:
1)	Describe your overarching interest in this dataset. What are some meaningful meaningful plots and other visuals (e.g. Heatmap of the geographic location of precipitation or Min/Max temp) to illustrate temperature trends over time in Australia?
2)	Hypothesis testing: Have temperatures significantly changed over the time frame we are analyzing? Is it a sign of the presence of global warming? Design a test statistic to address the difference of temperatures.
3)	Linear Regression: What is the relationship between temperature and C02 emissions? What if we account for pressure and humidity? Investigate the relationship between the two variables.
4)	Machine Learning: Can we effectively predict rain tomorrow using the data we have? How impactful are the features we regarded important in the previous parts? How far are the modelâ€™s performances from the state-of-the-art? Choose to implement one model between: XGBoost, Random Forest or some ensemble methods.
6)	Conclusions and Summary: Summarize the findings and state the main takeaways
